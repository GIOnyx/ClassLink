GitHub Copilot: I'll start by creating a todo plan and then open the client `package.json` and `src/services/backend.js` to check if axios is installed and how it's imported. I'll update the todo list and proceed based on what I find.

Created 4 todos

I'll open both files in parallel: `client/package.json` and `client/src/services/backend.js` so we can decide whether axios needs installing. Expected outcome: confirm whether axios is listed and see the import line.

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/admin/Documents/3RD_YEAR_BSIT/ClassLink/ClassLink/client/package.json)

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/admin/Documents/3RD_YEAR_BSIT/ClassLink/ClassLink/client/src/services/backend.js)

Now I'll mark the inspection as completed and start installing dependencies (run npm install in the client folder) so Vite can resolve axios. I'll run the install and then check that `node_modules/axios` exists.

Starting (2/4) *Install axios in client*

Ran terminal command: cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\client; npm install

Now I'll run the install using cmd so PowerShell's execution policy doesn't block the npm script, then check for the `axios` folder in `node_modules`. Expected outcome: dependencies installed and `node_modules/axios` present.

Ran terminal command: cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\client && npm install"

Starting (3/4) *Verify installation and restart dev server*

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/admin/Documents/3RD_YEAR_BSIT/ClassLink/ClassLink/client/node_modules/axios)

What I did next and why
- Checked package.json and backend.js to confirm whether `axios` was declared and how it's imported.
- Installed client dependencies (to ensure `axios` and other deps are present).
- Verified `node_modules/axios` exists.

Findings (quick)
- `axios` is present in package.json dependencies ("axios": "^1.4.0").
- backend.js imports axios with `import axios from 'axios';` and creates an API instance — the import is correct.
- `npm install` completed and `client/node_modules/axios` is present. Vite's "failed to resolve import 'axios'" was caused by missing/unsatisfied client node modules.

What I ran
- I ran `npm install` in the client folder (used cmd to avoid PowerShell execution-policy blocking npm scripts). Installation output showed packages added and a couple of EPERM cleanup warnings (often caused by locked files/antivirus).

Verification
- I listed `client/node_modules/axios` and it contains `index.js`, package.json, etc., so axios is installed.

Next steps (what to do now)
- Restart your Vite dev server so it picks up the newly installed packages. Here are safe commands you can run from PowerShell.

Option A — restart using PowerShell by allowing npm script for this process (temporary):
```powershell
cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\client
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
npm run dev
```

Option B — run the npm script via cmd (avoids PowerShell execution policy):
```powershell
cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\client && npm run dev"
```

If the dev server still shows the same error after restarting:
- Try clearing caches and reinstalling:
  1. Stop dev server.
  2. Delete `client/node_modules` and `client/package-lock.json` (if you want to re-create lockfile) or keep lockfile and run `npm ci`.
  3. Run (from cmd to avoid PS policy): `cmd /c "cd <client-path> && npm ci"`
- If you see EPERM errors during install repeatedly, try:
  - Close other processes that may lock files (editors, running dev servers).
  - Temporarily disable antivirus or Windows Defender real-time protection.
  - Run the command prompt as Administrator for reinstall.

Notes and small troubleshooting tips
- The PowerShell error you originally saw ("npm.ps1 cannot be loaded... scripts is disabled") is an execution-policy issue; I used `cmd /c` to run npm successfully.
- The EPERM warnings during cleanup are not fatal but indicate some files were locked on cleanup; if they persist, try the suggestions above.
- If after reinstall and restart Vite still can't resolve `axios`, we'll next inspect `vite.config.js` for path aliases or examine console errors in more detail.

Todo list status (progress)
- Inspect client package & backend — completed
- Install axios in client — completed
- Verify installation & restart dev server — in-progress (waiting on you to restart dev server or confirm you want me to start it)
- Check import path & vite config if still failing — not-started

If you want, I can:
- Start the dev server for you from here (I can run it in the background). Or
- Retry a full clean + `npm ci` if you'd like me to re-run installs and cleanup. Which would you prefer?

nahuyadada: how can i connect my project database to my MySQL workbench

GitHub Copilot: I'll open the server `application.properties` to see the current DB configuration, then I'll explain how to configure Spring Boot to use MySQL and how to connect with MySQL Workbench.

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/admin/Documents/3RD_YEAR_BSIT/ClassLink/ClassLink/server/src/main/resources/application.properties)

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/admin/Documents/3RD_YEAR_BSIT/ClassLink/ClassLink/server/pom.xml)

Added 2 todos

Good — I inspected your application.properties and it's already set to use a local MySQL database:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/classlink_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=gwapo123
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Below are clear, step-by-step instructions to connect your project to MySQL and access it from MySQL Workbench, plus commands and troubleshooting.

## Quick checklist
- MySQL server running (local or remote)
- Database `classlink_db` exists (or allow Spring Boot to create it)
- Correct username/password in application.properties
- MySQL JDBC driver present (your pom.xml already includes `mysql-connector-j`)
- App started (Maven) and connection successful
- MySQL Workbench connection created and tested

## 1) Ensure MySQL server is running
- If installed locally, start MySQL Server (Windows Services, or via MySQL Installer).
- To confirm from a terminal:
  - In PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT VERSION(), @@hostname, @@port;"
    ```
    Enter your password when prompted. If `mysql` isn't in PATH, run it from the MySQL installation directory or use MySQL Workbench.

## 2) Create the database (if it doesn't exist)
You can let Spring Boot create tables automatically (because `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`) but the DB itself must exist. Create it manually with MySQL Workbench or a SQL command:

- From a terminal or Workbench SQL editor run:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS classlink_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Optionally create a dedicated DB user instead of using `root`:
```sql
CREATE USER 'classlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON classlink_db.* TO 'classlink_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Then update application.properties:
```
spring.datasource.username=classlink_user
spring.datasource.password=strongpassword
```

## 3) Confirm Spring Boot config
Your application.properties already has:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/classlink_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=gwapo123
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
This is correct for local MySQL on default port 3306.

If your DB is remote or on a different port, change the URL:
```
jdbc:mysql://db-host.example.com:3306/classlink_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
```
I recommend adding `serverTimezone=UTC` and explicitly `useSSL=false` (or configure SSL properly) if necessary.

## 4) Start the Spring Boot app and watch the logs
From your repository `server` folder you can use the Maven wrapper already included.

PowerShell (may have execution policy issues, so I'll show cmd and PowerShell):
- Using the Maven wrapper (Windows cmd):
```powershell
cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server && mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run"
```
- Or from PowerShell (if mvnw.cmd in dir):
```powershell
cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Look for log lines like:
- "Successfully acquired ... Connection" or
- "Connected to database 'classlink_db' (JPA/Hibernate startup messages)"
Or errors such as "Access denied for user" or "Communications link failure".

## 5) Connect with MySQL Workbench
- Open MySQL Workbench -> MySQL Connections -> + New Connection
- Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)
- Hostname: localhost
- Port: 3306
- Username: root (or `classlink_user` if you created one)
- Password: either store in vault or click Test Connection and enter password when prompted
- Click "Test Connection" — you should see success. Then click OK and open the connection.
- In the left schema browser, refresh and open the `classlink_db` schema; you should see tables created when Spring runs (if ddl-auto created them).

## 6) Common issues & fixes

- "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'":
  - Check username/password in application.properties.
  - If using a remote machine, ensure root is allowed remote access or create a dedicated user with proper host.
  - Grant privileges as shown above.

- "Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' not supported":
  - This happens with MySQL 8 default auth plugin. Your connector typically supports it if recent, but if you see errors, you can:
    - Change the user to use legacy plugin (not recommended for production):
      ```sql
      ALTER USER 'classlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'strongpassword';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      ```
    - Or upgrade connector version (you already have `mysql-connector-j` in pom.xml; ensure it's recent enough).

- "Communications link failure / Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306'":
  - Ensure MySQL service is running.
  - Check firewall or port blocking.
  - Ensure the JDBC URL host matches where MySQL is running (localhost vs VM/WSL).

- EPERM or locked files during build/install (from earlier npm run):
  - Close apps that may lock files (editors, servers).
  - Restart the system if locks persist.
  - Run installations or server with admin privileges if needed.

## Useful commands (copyable)

Create DB and user (run in MySQL Workbench or mysql CLI):
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS classlink_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'classlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON classlink_db.* TO 'classlink_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Start the server (from project server folder):
```powershell
# via cmd wrapper (works around PowerShell policy)
cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server && mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run"
```

Check DB from command line:
```powershell
mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'classlink_db';"
```

## Next steps I can do for you
- Run the Maven command to start the Spring server and check logs for DB connectivity (I can run it here).
- Create the database and/or a dedicated user for you (I can execute SQL if you give me permission and have a way to run mysql CLI on your machine — typically I can't perform remote actions without access).
- Help you create and test a MySQL Workbench connection step-by-step and interpret any errors.

Which would you like me to do next? Start the Spring server now and watch the logs, or walk you through creating the DB and Workbench connection interactively?

nahuyadada: now connect it

GitHub Copilot: I'll (1) update the plan to create the database and start the Spring Boot server, then (2) attempt to create `classlink_db` using the local mysql client and finally (3) start the Spring Boot app to verify the connection; expected outcome: DB created (or existing) and server connects successfully.

Completed (1/6) *Verify MySQL server running*

Progress update — server connected to MySQL
- I started the Spring Boot server (using the project's `mvnw.cmd`) and confirmed it successfully obtained a DB connection. Key log lines:
  - "HikariPool-1 - Added connection com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ConnectionImpl@..."
  - "Tomcat started on port 8080 ... Started ServerApplication in 3.73 seconds"
- That means your application.properties settings (jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/classlink_db, root/gwapo123) worked and the app is connected.

What I ran
- Started server in the background:
  cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server && mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run"

Next — connect with MySQL Workbench (what you should do now)
1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Click the "+" next to MySQL Connections to create a new connection.
   - Connection Name: ClassLink (or whatever you prefer)
   - Hostname: localhost
   - Port: 3306
   - Username: root (or your DB user)
   - Password: gwapo123 (click "Store in Vault..." or leave blank and click Test Connection to enter it each time)
3. Click "Test Connection" — it should succeed.
4. Open the connection and refresh the schemas list. You should see `classlink_db`. Expand it to see tables (if Spring created them).

If you prefer a quick verify from the command line (in case Workbench isn't available), run (PowerShell/cmd):
```powershell
# Using the mysql CLI (if available)
mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'classlink_db';"
mysql -u root -p -e "USE classlink_db; SHOW TABLES;"
```
Enter password `gwapo123` when prompted.

Optional: create a non-root DB user (recommended)
Run this in Workbench or the mysql CLI:
```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'classlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON classlink_db.* TO 'classlink_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Then update application.properties to use `classlink_user` and `strongpassword`.

If you want, I can:
- Open the MySQL Workbench connection for you (I can't control GUI apps on your PC, but I can walk you step-by-step while you click).
- Create the non-root DB user for you via the mysql CLI (I attempted some mysql CLI commands earlier; they were blocked/interactive — I can retry if you want me to run commands here).
- Stop or restart the Spring server, or show specific tables created by JPA.

Which of these would you like me to do next?

Looks great—your Workbench screenshot shows the `classlink_db` schema with all the tables Spring Boot generated, so the app and Workbench are both using the `root` / `gwapo123` credentials successfully.

- You can keep working with that root account, but for day‑to‑day development I still recommend creating a dedicated MySQL user (e.g., `classlink_user`) and updating `spring.datasource.username/password`—it’s safer and avoids accidental superuser operations.
- If you stick with root, just be mindful when running SQL scripts so you don’t modify other schemas.
- The Spring Boot server we launched is still running; when you’re finished, stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or restart it any time with:
  ```powershell
  cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server && mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run"
  ```

Let me know if you’d like me to script the non-root user creation or wire up anything else.

- Frontend: send cookies with axios, add auth helpers, wire Login.jsx to call the backend, and auto-restore session on page refresh.

What I changed
- Server
  - Added `AuthController` with session endpoints:
    - POST `/api/auth/login` — sets HttpSession attributes on success
    - GET `/api/auth/me` — returns current session state
    - POST `/api/auth/logout` — invalidates session
    - File: `server/src/main/java/com/classlink/server/controller/AuthController.java`
  - Added simple repo queries for demo auth:
    - `AdminRepository.findByEmailAndPassword(...)`
    - `StudentRepository.findByEmailAndPassword(...)`
  - Enabled CORS for credentials and configured allowed origin:
    - New: `app.cors.allowed-origin=http://localhost:5173`
    - Updated controllers to use `@CrossOrigin(origins = "${app.cors.allowed-origin}", allowCredentials = "true")`
    - Global CORS filter: `server/src/main/java/com/classlink/server/config/CorsConfig.java`
  - Session cookie tweaks for local dev in application.properties:
    - `server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=Lax`
    - `server.servlet.session.cookie.secure=false`

- Client
  - Axios now sends cookies and points to Spring Boot on 8080 by default:
    - backend.js:
      - `withCredentials: true`
      - baseURL default `http://localhost:8080/api`
      - Added helpers: `login`, `me`, `logout`
  - Login wired to backend session:
    - Login.jsx now calls `login(email, password, 'student')` and shows error on failure
  - App loads session on refresh and logs out via API:
    - App.jsx checks `/auth/me` on mount to restore login state and calls `/auth/logout` on Logout

How to run
- Start the backend:
  ```powershell
  cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server && mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run"
  ```
- Start the frontend:
  ```powershell
  cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\client && npm run dev"
  ```
- Try it:
  1) Open http://localhost:5173
  2) Click Login, enter a Student email/password that exists in your DB (demo uses plaintext for now), submit.
  3) Refresh the page — you should stay logged in (session cookie).
  4) Click Logout — session is invalidated and the UI returns to the public view.

Notes and gotchas
- Security: For demo simplicity, the login uses email+password directly from DB. For real use, store hashed passwords (e.g., BCrypt) and implement proper auth/roles.
- CORS: If your dev client runs on a different origin, update `app.cors.allowed-origin` in application.properties accordingly.
- Cookies: `SameSite=Lax` and `secure=false` are set for local dev. If you serve over HTTPS or a different domain, switch to `SameSite=None` and `secure=true`.

Status and quick verification
- Backend built and ran successfully after changes; DB connection working.
- Frontend compiles locally in dev; axios is configured to send credentials.

Want me to add a minimal “protected route” example on the server (e.g., only allow creating courses when session is present) and show how the client reacts to 401s?

Completed (1/5) *Add /auth/register endpoint*

Nice—let’s add a student registration flow end-to-end with sessions, and wire it into your UI.

Plan
- Backend: add POST /api/auth/register that creates a Student and auto-logs them in via HttpSession.
- Client: create a Register modal, add a “Register” button to the header, and persist login after registration.
- CORS/cookies: already set to allow credentials; axios will send cookies.

What I implemented
- Server
  - New registration API with auto-login
    - File: server/src/main/java/com/classlink/server/controller/AuthController.java
    - Endpoint: POST /api/auth/register
    - Validates required fields, checks duplicate email, creates Student, sets session, returns basic profile
  - Repository helpers
    - StudentRepository.java
      - Added findByEmail(String email)
  - CORS and session cookies (already added earlier)
    - application.properties: app.cors.allowed-origin=http://localhost:5173 and session cookie settings
    - Controllers use @CrossOrigin(origins = "${app.cors.allowed-origin}", allowCredentials = "true")
- Client
  - API helpers
    - backend.js
      - withCredentials: true, default baseURL http://localhost:8080/api
      - Added register(payload), plus existing login/me/logout
  - Registration UI
    - New Register modal component: client/src/components/Register.jsx
      - Fields: firstName, lastName, email, password, confirmPassword
      - Validates inputs, shows inline errors, submits to /auth/register
      - On success: calls onRegisterSuccess (which triggers app login) and closes itself
  - Header + Landing page wiring
    - client/src/components/BrandHeader.jsx: new Register button prop onRegisterClick
    - client/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx: state to show/hide Register modal; passes onLoginSuccess to auto-log you in after registering
  - Persist login on refresh
    - client/src/App.jsx: checks /auth/me on mount; logout calls backend /auth/logout

How to try it
1) Start backend:
   ```powershell
   cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\server && mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run"
   ```
2) Start frontend:
   ```powershell
   cmd /c "cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\3RD_YEAR_BSIT\ClassLink\ClassLink\client && npm run dev"
   ```
3) In the app:
   - Click Register in the header.
   - Fill first name, last name, email, password, confirm password.
   - Submit. On success, you’ll be considered logged in (session cookie set) and the app switches to MainLayout.
   - Refresh page to confirm the session persists (App.jsx calls /auth/me).
   - Use Logout to invalidate the session.

Security and notes
- Passwords are stored as plain text right now for demo purposes. For production, switch to BCrypt (Spring Security’s PasswordEncoder) and never store raw passwords.
- If your Vite dev server runs on a different port, update app.cors.allowed-origin in application.properties.
- For HTTPS or cross-domain usage, set:
  - server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=None
  - server.servlet.session.cookie.secure=true

Files changed
- server/src/main/java/com/classlink/server/controller/AuthController.java — added /auth/register and support records
- StudentRepository.java — findByEmail
- backend.js — register(), withCredentials, baseURL 8080
- client/src/components/Register.jsx — new registration modal
- BrandHeader.jsx — Register button
- LandingPage.jsx — modal wiring
- App.jsx — session check on mount; API logout

Quality checks
- Build server: PASS
- Start server: PASS (connected to MySQL and serving)
- Client dev server: PASS (Vite served on available port)
- End-to-end sanity: Registration flow compiles and should set session; if any UI glitch, we can tweak styles quickly.

Want me to:
- Switch to hashed passwords and add a quick Spring Security PasswordEncoder?
- Make registration also capture optional fields (program, department, yearLevel)?

Thanks for the screenshot—that helped. The likely cause is CORS + credentials: your Vite dev server switched to port 5174, but the backend only allowed 5173. I’ve fixed this and made CORS accept multiple origins.

What I changed just now
- Backend CORS: allows comma‑separated origins and includes both 5173 and 5174.
  - Updated `CorsConfig` to parse `app.cors.allowed-origin` as a comma-separated list.
  - Updated application.properties:
    app.cors.allowed-origin=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
- Improved Register error messages to surface server responses (so you’ll see “Email already in use” or validation details instead of a generic “Registration failed”).
  - File: `client/src/components/Register.jsx`

What to do next
1) Restart the backend (I already restarted it with the new settings). If you restarted Vite recently, it’s probably on http://localhost:5174 — which is now allowed.
2) Refresh the app and try registering again.

If it still fails, here’s how to quickly pinpoint it
- If the error changes to “Email already in use,” try a different email.
- If it shows “Not allowed by server (CORS or credentials). Refresh and try again,” make sure you’re on 5173 or 5174 and the backend is running at 8080.
- If you get “Invalid input,” make sure all fields are filled and passwords match.

Optional hardening next
- Add a unique constraint to Student.email to enforce uniqueness at DB level.
- Hash passwords with BCrypt and a PasswordEncoder (recommended).
- Expand the registration payload to include program/department/year if needed.

Want me to add the unique email constraint and switch to hashed passwords next?

I can see the problem! In the `addEnrollment` function, you're adding the entry to the local state **twice**:
1. First with `setStudents((prev) => [newEntry, ...prev]);`
2. Then again after the POST succeeds with another `setStudents`

Perfect! Now let me create a summary document of the improvements: 

Completed (5/5) *Test and verify fixes*

## Fixed! Here's what I did to resolve the duplicate enrollment issue and improve the UI:

### Root Cause of Duplicates
The problem was in the `addEnrollment` function—it was adding entries to the local state **twice**:
1. First optimistically with a temporary ID
2. Again after the server responded

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Fixed Duplicate Issue** ✅
- **File**: EnrollmentPage.jsx
- Removed the double `setStudents` calls
- Now only adds to state once after successful server response
- Added proper error handling with user alerts

#### 2. **Added GET Endpoint** ✅
- **File**: EnrollmentController.java
- New endpoint: `GET /api/enrollments` to fetch all enrollments
- **File**: backend.js
- Added `getEnrollments()` helper function

#### 3. **Completely Redesigned UI** ✅
Major improvements to the enrollment page:

**Better Form Design:**
- Labeled inputs with clear descriptions
- Course selection now **required** (prevents incomplete enrollments)
- Shows course code + title in dropdown
- Professional styling with proper spacing
- Loading states (button disables during submission)
- Better error messages

**Enhanced Enrollment Display:**
- Clean card-based layout with shadows and borders
- Shows student name, program, semester, course code, and status
- Counter showing total enrollments
- Empty state message when no enrollments exist
- Loading indicator while fetching data
- Responsive grid layout

**Data Flow:**
- Fetches real enrollments from the server on load
- Refreshes automatically after adding new enrollment
- No more mock data mixing with real data

#### 4. **Visual Improvements** ✨
- Burgundy primary button (#8B0000) matching your brand
- Dark gray secondary button
- Proper form labels with asterisks for required fields
- Card-based enrollment display with hover effects
- Clean typography hierarchy
- Better spacing and padding throughout

### How to Test
1. **Backend is running** on port 8080 ✅
2. **Frontend**: refresh your Vite dev server (should be on 5173 or 5174)
3. Try enrolling a student:
   - Enter a name
   - Select program & semester
   - **Must select a course** (now required)
   - Click "Add Enrollment"
4. You should see:
   - Only **one entry** appears (no duplicates!)
   - Clean card UI showing all details
   - Enrollment count updates
   - Form clears after submission

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add unique constraint at DB level to prevent duplicate student+course enrollments
- Add delete/edit functionality for enrollments
- Filter enrollments by program/semester (requires adding these fields to Student model)
- Add pagination if enrollment list gets large
- Add search functionality

Want me to add any of these enhancements, or shall we test the current improvements first?

I’ll wire program selection into your Course management UI so new courses are created with an associated program and the list displays it.

## Actions taken

- Updated CoursePage.jsx:
  - Added a `programs` array (same choices as the Enrollment page).
  - Extended the “Add Course” form with a Program dropdown.
  - Ensured `newCourse` includes `program` (defaulting to the first program).
  - After adding a course, the form resets including the selected program.
  - Displayed each course’s `program` in the course list (shows “—” if missing).

## How to try it

- In the Course page:
  - Use the new Program dropdown when creating a course.
  - Submit; the course will be created with its program and appear in the list with the program label on the right.
- This also supports your Enrollment flow: since backend filtering by `?program=` is already in place, adding courses with a program ensures they show up under the correct program in Enrollment.

## Notes

- Existing courses that were created before the `program` column was added may show “—”. You can edit/recreate them with a program selection or add a small admin edit UI later.
- Backend already supports `program` on `Course`:
  - `Course.program` field exists.
  - `POST /api/courses` accepts it.
  - `GET /api/courses?program=...` filters as expected.

## Quality gates

- Lint/Typecheck: PASS for the modified file.
- Build: Not required for backend. Frontend hot-reloads; no new compile errors expected.
- Tests: None applicable in this change.

## Next small improvements

- Add program to Course edit (if you have editing) to update older records.
- Seed or backfill existing courses with a program so Enrollment always shows relevant options.

Completed (1/5) *Review student models and APIs*

I’ll add an Admin “Students” tab that lets you create students by email (with default password 123456) and shows a list of all students; I’ll also add the backend endpoint to support it.

## Actions taken

- Backend: `AdminController` implemented
  - File: AdminController.java
  - Endpoints:
    - GET `/api/admin/students` → returns all students
    - POST `/api/admin/students` → creates a student; requires email, sets default password to 123456 if not provided, returns 409 if email already exists
  - CORS: Respects your `app.cors.allowed-origin` setting and allows credentials

- Frontend service: Admin student API helpers
  - File: backend.js
  - Added:
    - `getStudents()` → GET `/admin/students`
    - `createStudent(payload)` → POST `/admin/students`
  - Existing axios config continues to send credentials

- Admin Students tab UI
  - File: StudentPage.jsx
  - Replaced mock UI with:
    - “Create New Student” form: first name, last name, email, program, year level, department
      - Note shown: default password is 123456
      - Client-side required checks for first/last name and email
      - On submit, calls backend to create student; conflicts and errors are shown
    - “All Students” table: name, email, program, year, department
      - Auto-refreshes after creation
      - Loading state and empty-state message

## Build/validation

- Backend build: PASS
  - Ran a Maven package build; result was BUILD SUCCESS and jar repackage completed.
- Frontend compile checks for changed files: PASS (no type/syntax errors reported for the edited files)
- Tests: None applicable for these changes in the current repo.

## How to use

- Start your backend server (if not already running).
- Open the Admin “Students” tab (page StudentPage.jsx).
  - Fill in first name, last name, and email.
  - Pick program/year/department if desired.
  - Click “Create Student”.
  - The student appears in the list with their email; their password is 123456 by default.

## Notes and next steps

- Security: Passwords are stored in plaintext right now (as per current model). When ready, we should:
  - Hash passwords (e.g., BCrypt) and update login to verify hashes.
  - Add uniqueness constraint on email at the DB layer to prevent race-condition duplicates.
- If you’d like, I can add edit/delete actions for students and a quick “Reset Password to 123456” button for admins.

Thanks for the screenshot—I'll fix the registration failure by cleaning up CORS so the browser can actually reach the register endpoint with credentials.

## What I changed

- Unified CORS to avoid conflicts:
  - Removed per-controller CORS annotations so we rely solely on the global CORS filter that already parses multiple origins properly.
  - Files updated:
    - AuthController.java
    - CourseController.java
    - EnrollmentController.java
    - AdminController.java
  - Kept the global filter in CorsConfig.java which:
    - Splits `app.cors.allowed-origin=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174`
    - Allows credentials, standard methods/headers, and maps to `/**`

Why this matters: The annotation-based CORS with a comma-separated property can be treated as a single invalid origin by the framework, causing preflight to fail. When that happens, Axios reports a generic network error, which your UI shows as “Registration failed.”

## What to do next

- Restart the backend server so the CORS changes take effect.
- Refresh the browser and try registering again.
  - If the email is already in use, you’ll now see “Email already in use.”
  - Otherwise, you should be auto-logged in on success.

## Quick checks if it still fails

- Confirm the frontend origin matches one of the configured ones:
  - `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5174` in `application.properties`:
    - `app.cors.allowed-origin=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174`
- Ensure your Axios instance has withCredentials=true (it does in backend.js).
- Check the Network tab for the POST `/api/auth/register`:
  - If you see “CORS error” or no status code, it’s still a preflight issue.
  - If you see 409 with JSON `{ error: "Email already in use" }`, the UI should now show that exact message.

## Quality gates

- Build: PASS (previous compile checks; updated code compiles without errors)
- Lint/Typecheck: PASS for modified files
- Tests: None configured for this flow

If you want, I can also add a very small “server health” ping in the client and surface a clearer banner if the API is unreachable due to CORS or network issues.

    - Origins from `app.cors.allowed-origin` (still respected)
    - Plus `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` for any dev port
  - Keeps: allowCredentials=true, headers=*, methods=GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS

Why this helps: If Vite started on 5175 or you opened via 127.0.0.1, the preflight would fail before. With patterns, the browser will complete preflight and the request will reach `/api/auth/register`.

Build status: Backend rebuild PASS.

## What you should do now

1. Restart the Spring Boot server so the new CORS settings apply.
2. Refresh the browser and try registering again with a brand new email.
   - If the email is already used, you’ll see “Email already in use.”
   - On success, you’ll be auto-logged in.
3. If it still shows “Registration failed”:
   - Open DevTools → Network → click the failed `register` request.
   - If you see “CORS error” or no status code, confirm the page origin matches localhost/127.0.0.1 and the server is on 8080.
   - If you see an HTTP status and JSON `{ error: ... }`, the UI should now show that message—tell me what it says if it’s unexpected.

Notes:
- Your `application.properties` remains valid:
  - `app.cors.allowed-origin=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174` still works, and now any localhost port is also allowed via patterns.
- Axios is already sending credentials; SameSite=Lax is fine for localhost on different ports.

Let’s knock out the “Registration failed” by ensuring the request gets to the server and returns a clear message. I centralized CORS properly and upgraded error messaging so you’ll see the real reason next time.

## What I changed just now
- Global CORS made dev-proof:
  - CorsConfig.java: uses allowedOriginPatterns and adds `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` so any dev port works with credentials.
  - Removed per-controller `@CrossOrigin` (Auth/Course/Enrollment/Admin) to avoid conflicts.
- Better client error messages:
  - Register.jsx: shows specific causes like “Cannot reach server (CORS or server down)” or “Email already in use,” and includes HTTP status when applicable. It also logs details to the browser console.

Build status: Backend rebuild PASS.

## What to do now (1–2 minutes)
1. Restart the backend server.
2. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5).
3. Try registering again with a brand-new email.
4. If it still fails, check:
   - Browser console: there’ll be a “Register error” log with status/code.
   - Network tab: click the POST /api/auth/register and note the Status and Response.
   - The UI will now show a more specific error (e.g., “Cannot reach server (CORS or server down)” or “Email already in use”).

## If it still fails after restart
- Tell me exactly what the UI shows now (it will include the HTTP status or a network/CORS hint), or paste the console “Register error” object. That will let me pinpoint whether it’s still CORS/preflight, a 409 duplicate email, or an unexpected 5xx.

nahuyadada: if i am a diferent person how can i set this up when i clone this project from github

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/admin/Documents/3RD_YEAR_BSIT/ClassLink/ClassLink/server/src/main/java/com/classlink/server/model/Admin.java)

Good question—here’s a clean, repeatable way for anyone to clone and run this project on Windows.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 (JDK)
- Node.js LTS (includes npm)
- MySQL Server and Workbench
- Git

Optional but helpful:
- Postman/Thunder Client to poke APIs
- A code editor (you’re in VS Code already)

## 1) Clone the repo

```powershell
# PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/GIOnyx/ClassLink.git
cd ClassLink/ClassLink
```

## 2) Configure the database

You can reuse the defaults or change them. Defaults in `server/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

- DB: `classlink_db`
- User: `root`
- Pass: `gwapo123`

If you prefer a dedicated MySQL user:

```sql
-- Run these in MySQL Workbench
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS classlink_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Create a non-root user (recommended)
CREATE USER 'classlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON classlink_db.* TO 'classlink_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Then update `server/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/classlink_db
spring.datasource.username=classlink_user
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Notes:
- `ddl-auto=update` will create/alter tables automatically on first run.
- CORS is already configured for localhost dev with credentials.

## 3) Run the backend (Spring Boot)

```powershell
# From ClassLink/ClassLink/server
cd server
.\mvnw.cmd -DskipTests package
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Success criteria:
- Logs show Tomcat started on port 8080
- Hikari connects to MySQL without errors

If you use a different port, you can override quickly:
```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8081"
```

## 4) Run the frontend (Vite + React)

```powershell
# In a new terminal
cd ..\client
npm install
# Optional: if your API port isn’t 8080, create .env and set:
# echo VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081/api > .env
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

Axios is already set to:
- Base URL: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` or `http://localhost:8080/api` by default
- `withCredentials: true` for session cookies

CORS is configured to allow localhost with credentials and wildcard dev ports.

## 5) Try it: register and login

- Click “Register” in the UI and create a new Student account.
- On success, you’ll be auto-logged in (session cookie is stored).
- If you see “Email already in use,” pick another email.

If you still see a generic “Registration failed,” check the browser DevTools Network tab for the POST /api/auth/register and tell me the HTTP status—it will help pinpoint (409 duplicate, 400 invalid, or a CORS/network error).

## 6) Admin access (optional)

The system includes Admin entities for admin login. To create an admin on a fresh DB, insert one row (names can vary with naming strategy; start with this simple form which works for many setups):

```sql
INSERT INTO admin (name, email, password, role) VALUES ('Site Admin', 'admin@example.com', 'admin123', 'ADMIN');
```

Then log in using role “admin” at the login form. If your DB naming strategy snake-cases fields, the table/columns might be `admin`, columns like `admin_id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`—use your Workbench table browser to confirm actual names if the insert fails.

Tip: For production, switch to hashed passwords; right now it’s plaintext for simplicity.

## 7) Common pitfalls and fixes

- Registration still fails:
  - Make sure backend is running on 8080 (or set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `client/.env`).
  - Hard refresh the browser after backend restarts.
  - Check Network tab: if CORS/preflight fails, ensure you’re on `http://localhost:<port>` (not file://) and that the server logs show startup.
- MySQL auth errors:
  - Ensure the user exists and has privileges on `classlink_db`.
  - Verify host is `localhost` and port `3306`.
- Port already in use:
  - Change backend port via `-Dserver.port=8081` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081/api`.

## 8) Ready-made environment override (optional)

You can run without editing files by using system properties:

```powershell
# Example: change DB creds without editing application.properties
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run `
  -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/classlink_db -Dspring.datasource.username=classlink_user -Dspring.datasource.password=your_password"
```

And in the client:
```powershell
# If backend isn’t 8080
echo VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081/api > .env
```

## 9) Seeding data (optional, helpful)

- Add some courses via the Course page (now includes Program selection).
- Use the Admin “Students” tab to create students with default password 123456.
- Enrollment page should show program-specific courses if you set programs on courses.

That’s it—following these steps, any developer can clone, configure MySQL, run the backend and frontend, and start registering users. If you want, I can bundle these into a README “Quickstart” and add sample SQL seeds for admin/courses.
